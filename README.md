## OMap

A fork of _Ordered Associative Array_, slightly modified by Rėdas Peškaitis.

#### Additions:
1) tuple based OMap constructor 
2) method to export array of [key : value] tuples
3) methods to get, insert and delete values by integer index in the order of keys.

#### Repository

#### Original code
 
Ordered Associative Array modeled from Python's OrderedDict.
Subtypes built-in associative arrays.

It works by using an array to keep the key order in addition to a regular
associative array.

Ordered Associative Array was created by Cédric Picard.
